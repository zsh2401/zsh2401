# Looking for Help
My family no longer supported me to go to school and I have lost my economic source totally now. 

The reason why this thing happened is that my mom forced me to go to work without any reasonable reason and I do not agree this unreasonable compulsion.

So, the "BEST THING HER CAN DO" is stopped providing me living expenses.

You might say, I should look for a part-time job. But I'll choose the former in my dreams and reality again, I had been through this bleak situation many times, yes, my mom always do something strange like this time to me just like her is not my mother.

The difference is, this time she's cut off all communicating ways with me.

You might say that there must be so many things I had done let her down. Yes, I do agree to this point, but my story is too complex to explain under this situation and I had already do SO MANY THINGS to makeup those mistakes I had made in the past...   

You could read this article [Èõ®‰∏≠-Memoir](https://zsh2401.top/post/memoir) if you can understand chinese to learn about my experience.

Okay, all I want to say is I need help from others.

The best way to help me is borrow to me if you have the will and the ability. I don't want to receive donation because it's makes me like a beggar, I thought the best way to repay those who once helped me is pay back the money and interest to them, and strive to be useful to society.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH.    
I'LL NEVER FORGET YOU.
